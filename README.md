### Helper: bennugd.sh

Helper of `bgdc`, `bgdi`, `moddesc`and `gdb`.
The most useful way to use this script is: `bennugd file.prg`,
compile and run at the same time.

**Note:**

It must be edited before being used **or** export the following in
your configuration of your shell:

```bash

 export MY_BENNUGD_LIBS=/home/YOU/bennugd2/build/linux/bin
 export MY_BENNUGD_BINS=/home/YOU/bennugd2/build/linux/bin

 alias bennugd=~/bennugd2/bennugd.sh

```

**Example:**

```bash

$ bennugd file.prg               (compile and run)
$ bennugd -c file.prg            (compile only)
$ bennugd -c file.prg -o mygame  (compile with options)
$ bennugd -i mygame.dcb          (interpreter)
$ bennugd -g -c file.prg         (run gdb with bgdc)
$ bennugd -g -i mygame.dcb       (run gdb with bgdi)
$ bennugd -h                     (show help)

```
